# Music Classification with Imbalanced Data

In this project, we use an imbalanced dataset comprised of 'Hip-Hop' and 'Rock' music genres to classify music genres, using sampling techniques and various classification algorithms from Python's Sciekit-Learn library. We tune the hyperparameters of the relevant algorithms for maximizing the performance of the models. For shorter run time of codes, only a small chuck of the whole data, which including other music genres, has been selected. More details are available in the Jupyter notebook.

# Case-Study-04-Song-Genres-Classification

In this case study, we use a dataset comprised of 'Hip-Hop' and 'Rock' music genres, collected by a research group at [The Echo Nest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Echo_Nest) (now a part of [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify)) to classify music genres without listening to the songs. This sort of classification, for example, allows for personalized song recommendations by streaming services.
